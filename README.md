# FNaF Engine: Rust

**FNaF Engine: Rust** is a blazing-fast, modular game engine written in Rust, designed to empower developers to create **Five Nights at Freddy's**-style games. Inspired by the original **FNaF Engine** by SealedKiller, this engine is built for performance and minimal resource usage while staying faithful to the FNaF game design philosophy.


## Features

- **Written in Rust**: Built using Rust for high performance, safety, and concurrency.
- **FEScript Interpreter**: Includes a blazing-fast FEScript interpreter for game scripting.
- **Minimal Plugin Support**: Lightweight plugin system to extend functionality.
- **Low Resource Usage**: Uses barely any CPU or RAM, ensuring a smooth experience on most hardware.
- **Synchronous Design**: All systems run fully synchronous, processing one tick at a time in lockstep.
- **Modular Architecture**: Highly modular, making it easy to customize and extend core functionalities.


## Current Status

> **Warning**: The engine is currently **very incomplete** and **inactive**. Development has been abandoned, but the repository is still open for contributions. Pull requests are welcome, and the project remains unarchived for the community to build upon.


## Why FNaF Engine: Rust?

The original FNaF Engine, made in Clickteam Fusion, suffered from significant performance issues and was abandoned in favor of **FNaF Studio**, which is currently a private repository. **FNaF Engine: Rust** aims to overcome these limitations by providing:

- **Fastest Performance**: Designed to be the fastest FNaF game engine available.
- **Lightweight Design**: Minimal resource consumption ensures better performance even on older machines.
- **Deterministic Behavior**: Fully synchronous systems mean consistent and predictable behavior across all game logic.

This project is open to the community, and developers are free to use and adapt its code as needed.


## Usage

To start using **FNaF Engine: Rust**, clone the repository and use Cargo to build and run the engine:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Starbound-Games/FNaF-Engine-Rust.git
cd fnaf-engine-rust

# Run the engine
cargo run
```
